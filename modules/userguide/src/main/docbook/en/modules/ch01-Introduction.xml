    <title>What is it</title>
    <para>jBPM is an extensible and flexible process engine that can run 
    as a standalone server or embedded in any Java application.

    <title>Contents of this userguide</title>
    <para>In this user guide, we'll describe the jPDL 
    process language in persistent execution mode.  Persistent 
    execution mode means that process definitions, process executions 
    and process history is stored in a relational DB.  This is the common way 
    of how jBPM is used in practice. 
    </para>
    <para>This user guide explains the supported way on how to use jBPM.
    The developers guide explains more advanced customization options that 
    are not part of the support offerings.

  <section>
    <title>Migration from jBPM 3</title>
    <para>Migration from jBPM 3 to jBPM 4 is not supported. 
    Check out the developers guide for hints on how to perform the migration.

    <title>Reporting problems</title>
    <para>When reporting a problem in the user forum or in our support portal, please 
    use the following snippet as a template:
    </para>
    <programlisting><emphasis role="bold">=== Environment ==============================</emphasis>
- <emphasis role="bold">jBPM Version</emphasis> : which version of jBPM are you using?
- <emphasis role="bold">Database</emphasis> : which database and which version of that database
- <emphasis role="bold">JDK</emphasis> : which Java version are you using? use 'java -version' to find out
- <emphasis role="bold">Container</emphasis> : which container are you using? (JBoss, Tomcat, etc.)
- <emphasis role="bold">Configuration</emphasis> : is your jbpm.cfg.xml only using imports from the jbpm.jar
   lib itself? or did you create a custom config file?
- <emphasis role="bold">Libraries</emphasis> : are you using the exact versions of the libs from inside the jbpm
   distribution of the version that you're using? or did you change some of the libs?

<emphasis role="bold">=== Process ==================================</emphasis>
paste jPDL process here

<emphasis role="bold">=== API ===================================</emphasis>
paste the relevant code snippet that you use to invoke jBPM

<emphasis role="bold">=== Stacktrace ==============================</emphasis>
paste full stack trace here

<emphasis role="bold">=== Debug logs ==============================</emphasis>
paste debug logs here

<emphasis role="bold">=== Problem description =========================</emphasis>
Keep this part short and to the point. E.g. API doesn't work as expected. 
or e.g. method ExecutionService.signalExecutionById throws exception.</programlisting>
    <para>Clever readers will have noticed that some of these questions point to probably causes :-)
    Especially tweaking the libs and configuration can easily lead to trouble.  That's why 
    we have spend a great deal of effort to include default installations and a simplified 
    configuration mechanism with imports.  Think twice before you start to customize 
    configurations beyond what is indicated in this userguide.  Also think twice before 
    replacing libs with other versions.
